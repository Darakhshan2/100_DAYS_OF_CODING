//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsName:string[] =  ["ali","ayesha","ilsa","monu"];
for(let name of friendsName){
    console.log("hello",name)
}
